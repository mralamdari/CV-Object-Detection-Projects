# Computer Vision Object Detection Projects

### This Is a repository that was build to walk through various Object Detection Tasks and Learn from them.
### The purpose of this repository is not just to copy&paste the code from the Kaggle(everyone can do itðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜…). It is to write down each code, modify it and maybe improve it in a way that can be simpler and easier to understand.


### Some challenges are so long that they can't be represented in GitHub, so I have to separate them into several parts.
